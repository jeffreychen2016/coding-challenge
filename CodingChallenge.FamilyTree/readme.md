Context

	- You are given a family tree.  
	- This family tree is made up of people, each with a list of decendants.   
	- Each descendant is unique (we're only tracking one side of the family), and names are not repeated.
	
Given the following example family

				Ted
				 /\
				/  \
			     Jim  Sally
			     /      /\
			    /      /  \
		          Bob    Joe  George

Write a method that, given the person Ted and the string 'Joe' are passed in, will return Joe's birth month.
Once that is complete, augment the method to handle Names that do not exist in the family tree.  Keep in mind that the tree supplied above is just an example.  Your solution should be able to solve for any person/tree and any string name.
